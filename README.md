The MIEST is a comprehensive resource that provides a detailed synthesis of FGB/BNCC enrollments and classes across the state of São Paulo. This consolidated material brings together significant information, offering flexible visualization options to adapt to different contexts and meet diverse needs.

It features totals organized into two distinct views: “by cycle” and “by shift,” enabling extensive and detailed data analysis.

As part of a monthly publication initiative, we are committed to delivering MIEST in a progressively enhanced and expanded format, continuously reviewed to meet evolving demands and ensure transparency in educational data.
